# Sortable Coding Challenge

The goal of this project is to match a set of product listings against a set of known products, taking care not to incorrectly match any listings. The full details can be found at [http://sortable.com/challenge](http://sortable.com/challenge).

## Running The Code

Requires Python 3.

    cd src
    python3 ProductListingMatcher.py

You can also pass it three command line arguments specifying alternate products, listings, and results files, like so:

    python3 ProductListingMatcher.py products-file listings-file results-file`

## How It Works
